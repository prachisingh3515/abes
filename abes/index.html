                <p>There is something so beautiful about seeing someone carrying flowers in public like!!<br>
                     Aside  from how pretty I think they are I always wonder if they received them or if they are about to make someone's day a little better. <br>
                     Is it for a friend? Their lover? <br>
                     Someone they haven't seen in a long time? <br>
                     Did they treat themselves to a small joy?<br>
                      No matter the answer flowers in public will make all the beholders of this brief moment a little happier. </p>
